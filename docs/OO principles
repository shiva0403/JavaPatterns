OO principles

Encapsulate what varies
Favor composition over inheritance
Program to interfaces, not implementations
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

Observer - defines a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents
are notified and updated automatically
